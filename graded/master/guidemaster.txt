/*Mastermind

"Mastermind" is a game where a codemaker has a secret sequence of four digits, and a codebreaker must guess the correct composition and order of those digits.

After every guess, the codemaker provides feedback: every digit that is in the correct position gets a red mark, and every digit that exists in the answer, but is not in the correct position, gets a white mark.

Write a program that lets the user play Mastermind. It should pick a four-digit number, and let the user make any number of guesses, providing appropriate feedback.

Guess a number: 4272

Guess a number: 8242
4 red
You win!  It took you 6 guesses.

Having trouble? It may be easier to implement if the computer-picked number has four unique digits, instead of repeated digits, and then assume that the user will only type in unique digits, as well. Please add a comment to this effect if you take this approach.

Challenge: Add an option for the game to play itself. Done efficiently, this autoplay function should always win within 7 guesses.
